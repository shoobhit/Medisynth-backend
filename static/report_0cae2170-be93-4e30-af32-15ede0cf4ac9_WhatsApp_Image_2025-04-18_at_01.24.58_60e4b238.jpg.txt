Symptoms: Symptoms may include cough, chest pain, weight loss, or hemoptysis, though small masses may be asymptomatic.
Potential Causes: Causes include lung cancer, benign tumors, or infections like granulomas.
Clinical Implications: Urgent evaluation, possibly with biopsy, is required to rule out malignancy.
Pneumothorax:     Visual Findings: Absence of lung markings in the right upper lobe suggestive of pneumothorax.
Symptoms: Symptoms include sudden chest pain, shortness of breath, and rapid heart rate.
Potential Causes: Causes include trauma, lung disease, or spontaneous rupture of air sacs.
Clinical Implications: May require urgent intervention, such as chest tube insertion, to re-expand the lung.
