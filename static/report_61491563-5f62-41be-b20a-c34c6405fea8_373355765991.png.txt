**Summary of Findings**

The following conditions were identified with high confidence:

- Cardiomegaly: 20.04%
- Hernia: 63.60%
- Pleural_Thickening: 25.74%

**Detailed Analysis**

**Cardiomegaly**

**Radiographic Findings**
Cardiomegaly refers to an enlarged heart, often detected on imaging as an increased heart size.

**Clinical Symptoms**
Symptoms may include fatigue, shortness of breath, swelling in the legs, and irregular heartbeats, though it can be asymptomatic.

**Differential Diagnosis**
Causes include hypertension, heart valve disease, cardiomyopathy, or chronic lung disease leading to increased heart workload.

**Recommendations**
Cardiomegaly may indicate underlying heart disease requiring further cardiac evaluation, such as echocardiography.


**Hernia**

**Radiographic Findings**
Abnormal contour in the left upper chest suggestive of diaphragmatic hernia.

**Clinical Symptoms**
Symptoms may include chest pain, difficulty breathing, and gastrointestinal issues like reflux.

**Differential Diagnosis**
Can be congenital or acquired due to trauma or surgery.

**Recommendations**
Surgical repair may be needed, depending on severity and symptoms.


**Pleural_Thickening**

**Radiographic Findings**
Pleural thickening in the left upper lobe, indicating scarring of the lung lining.

**Clinical Symptoms**
Symptoms may include chest pain and reduced lung capacity, though it can be asymptomatic.

**Differential Diagnosis**
Causes include asbestos exposure, infections, or autoimmune diseases.

**Recommendations**
May require monitoring or treatment of the underlying cause.
